// CPlusPlus::Document is what Qt Creator's built-in code model is made of: a
// file, its symbols, the macros it defined and used, its diagnostics, and the
// questions an editor asks about a position -- which function is the cursor
// in, which scope, which symbol was last declared above it. Snapshot is a
// collection of them, and the lookup that resolves a name walks it.
//
// This is the same thing on the other model, as far as that model reaches. It
// holds one file: the collection and the lookup across it are the slices
// after this one. unsupportedQueries() says which of Document's questions
// cannot be answered yet and why, and tests/auto/cxxfrontend asserts on it.
//
// Deliberately no cxx/ header is included here: those need C++23, and only
// the implementation should have to.
