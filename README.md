## Supported Platforms

The standalone binary packages support the following platforms:

| Platform        | Architecture    | Minimum version    |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Windows         | x86_64          | Windows 10         |
| Windows         | ARM64           | Windows 11         |
| (K)Ubuntu Linux | x86_64          | 22.04 (glibc 2.34) |
| (K)Ubuntu Linux | arm64           | 24.04 (glibc 2.39) |
| macOS           | x86_64, arm64   | 13                 |

When you compile Qt Creator yourself, the Qt version that you build with
determines the supported platforms.

## Getting Started

To build Qt Creator yourself, you need Qt, CMake, Ninja, a C++ compiler, and the
Go compiler. Get the sources and build them as described in
[BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md):

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://code.qt.io/qt-creator/qt-creator.git
cmake -S qt-creator -B qtcreator_build -G Ninja "-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/Qt"
cmake --build qtcreator_build
```

## Contributing

Qt Creator is developed using the Gerrit code review tool. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit patches, and
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for how to run the tests.
