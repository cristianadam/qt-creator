The configuration file structure:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<node title="Docs">
    <node toc="tocname" childrenonly="true|false" parent_url="index.html"/>
    <node toc="tocname" childrenonly="true|false" parent_url="index.html">
        <node toc="tocname" childrenonly="true|false" parent_url="index.html"/>
    </node>
    <node title="Add-ons" href="addons.html">
        <node toc="tocname"/>
        <node toc="tocname"/>
        <node toc="tocname"/>
    </node>
</node>
```

A <node> entry can have the following attributes:

- To add a folder node, specify these properties:

    - `title`

        Specifies a name for a virtual folder. Can be used without any topic
        for this tree node. If only title is specified, you have just a collapsible node
        that stores other nodes.
    - `href`

        Specifies a topic assigned to a virtual folder (see `title`). When specified,
        you get a virtual node with a page that opens on opening the node. Note
        that the specified topic must already be in the tree, that means that
        the module, that contains this topic, must be included in the configuration tree
        before the current node.

- To attach a module, specify these properties:

    - 'toc' (required)

        Specifies a name of module (like a folder name, e.g., qtdoc, qtquick, etc),
        whose TOC is inserted here. The module's TOC is defined in the project's
        projectname-toc.qdoc file.
    - 'childrenonly' (optional)

        Specifies whether the whole module toc is included (that is the module's
        root topic and its children, default), or only the module's child nodes are
        included.
        If false (default), the whole TOC is inserted. If 'true', only the children
        of the TOC are inserted, without a root node.
    - 'parent_url' (optional)

        If specified, the TOC is appended as a child to a node with the specified topic.

The topmost root node is a folder that is not displayed anywhere. Don't change it.
