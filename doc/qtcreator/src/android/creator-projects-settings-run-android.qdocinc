    \section1 Specifying Run Settings for Android Devices

    To run and debug an application on an Android device, you must create
    connections from the development host to the device, as instructed in
    \l {Connecting Android Devices}.

    A default set of Android Activity manager (am) start options is applied when
    starting applications. You can specify additional start options in the
    \uicontrol {Activity manager start arguments} field. However, if the default
    options conflict with the added options, the application might not start.

    The default arguments for the Activity manager for a normal run:

    \badcode
    am start -n <package_name>/<QtActivity_name>
    \endcode

    The default arguments for the Activity manager for the debugger mode:

    \badcode
    am start -n <package_name>/<QtActivity_name> -D
    \endcode

    For example, to run the application as a particular user, enter the start
    option \c {--user 10}, where \c 10 is the user ID of the user account.

    You can specify shell commands to run before the application is started
    and after it is quit. For example, enter the following commands into
    \uicontrol{Pre-launch on-device shell commands} to unlock the screen and
    to switch to the user account \c 10 on the device before running the
    application:

    \code
    input keyevent 82
    am switch-user 10
    \endcode

    Enter the following commands into
    \uicontrol{Post-quit on-device shell commands} to switch back to the
    default user, \c 0, and to unlock the screen after the application is quit:

    \code
    am switch-user 0
    input keyevent 82
    \endcode
