    \title Find symbols

    To find instances of a specific symbol in your Qt C++ project:

    \list 1
        \li Place the cursor on the symbol in the editor.
        \li Go to \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol {C++} >
            \uicontrol {Find References to Symbol Under Cursor},
            or press \key {Ctrl+Shift+U}.
            \image qtcreator-find-references-to-symbol-under-cursor.png {Search results for finding references to symbols}
    \endlist

    \section1 Sort according to access type

    To view the same results color-coded according to the access type, such as
    read, write, or declaration, go to \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol {C++} >
    \uicontrol {Find References with Access Type}.

    \section1 Search for symbols

    Go to \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol {Find/Replace} >
    \uicontrol {Advanced Find} and select \uicontrol {C++ Symbols} to search for
    classes, functions, enums, and declarations (including type aliases) either
    from files listed as part of the project or from all files that are used by
    the code, such as include files.

    \QC searches from the following locations:

    \list
        \li Files listed as a part of the project
        \li Files directly used by the project files (for example, generated
            files)
        \li Header files of used frameworks and libraries
    \endlist

    \section1 View found symbols

    \l{Search Results View} shows the location and number of search hits in the
    current project.
