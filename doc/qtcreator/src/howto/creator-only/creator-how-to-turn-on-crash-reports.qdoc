    \title Turn on crash reports

    \QC uses Google Crashpad to collect information about crashes and to send it
    to the Qt backend for processing. Crashpad might capture arbitrary contents
    from the memory of the crashed process, including user-sensitive information,
    URLs, and other content users have trusted \QC with. However, the crash
    reports are used for the sole purpose of fixing software errors.

    To turn on crash reports:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol System.
            \image qtcreator-preferences-environment-system.webp {System preferences}
        \li Select \uicontrol {Enable crash reporting}.
    \endlist

    To free up disk space that crash reports reserve on the computer,
    select \uicontrol {Clear Local Crash Reports}. You can see the
    size of the crash reports next to the button.

    Select \uicontrol ? to view more information about Crashpad and the security
    policy.
