    \title Creating Qt Quick Effect Maker Files

    \section1 Creating an Effect File

    You can create empty Qt Quick Effect Maker effect (.qep) files in \QDS and
    then edit them in Qt Quick Effect Maker.

    To create an effect file:

    \list 1
      \li In \QDS, go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File}.
      \li Go to the \uicontrol Effects tab and select
      \uicontrol {Effect file (Effect Maker)}.
      \image new-effect-file.png
      \li Select \uicontrol Choose and follow the wizard to create the file.
    \endlist

    After you have created the effect file, it is available in the
    \uicontrol Assets view.

    \section2 Editing and Re-importing an Effect File

    To edit an effect file in Qt Quick Effect Maker, double-click it in
    the \uicontrol Assets view. This opens the effect in Qt Quick Effect
    Maker where you can make your changes.

    When you have edited the effect file in Qt Quick Effect Maker, you need
    to save and export it:
    \list 1
      \li In Qt Quick Effect Maker, go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Save.
      \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Export.
      \li With the default settings, select \uicontrol Ok.

    \endlist

    Now, you can close Qt Quick Effect Maker and return to \QDS and apply the
    effect.

    \section1 Applying an Effect

    You can apply effects to components in \QDS. To do so, drag the effect
    from the \uicontrol Assets view to the component in \uicontrol Navigator or
    the \uicontrol 2D view.

    \section1 Animated Effect

    When you import an animated effect, you need to turn on the animation for it
    to see the animation in your \QDS application.

    To turn on animation for an effect, first apply the effect to a component,
    and then:

    \list 1
      \li Select the effect in \uicontrol Navigator.
      \li In \uicontrol Properties, go to the
      \uicontrol {Exposed Custom Properties} section and set
      \uicontrol timeRunning to true.
    \endlist
