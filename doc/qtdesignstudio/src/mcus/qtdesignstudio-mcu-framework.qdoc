    \title \QMCU framework

    \QMCU is a comprehensive framework that supports various hardware ecosystems
    and platforms. One of the most important libraries provided by the \QMCU
    framework is \QUL (QUL), a lightweight implementation of the Qt Quick
    framework. \QUL provides a QML API and an efficient graphics rendering engine
    that has a low memory footprint and is optimized for MCUs and other
    resource-constrained devices.

    In addition to a lightweight graphics framework, \QMCU offers a toolkit that
    enables you to design, develop, and deploy graphical user interfaces (GUI)
    on microcontrollers (MCU). Also, depending on the target device, it lets you
    run your applications on Bare Metal, Linux, RTOS, or ZephyrÂ® operating
    systems. For more information on the supported target devices, compilers,
    and operating systems, see \l {supported MCU target devices}.

    \note You can also use the desktop kit to run and test your application on
    desktop without flashing it each time.

    For more information on \QMCU, see \l {\QMCU documentation}.
