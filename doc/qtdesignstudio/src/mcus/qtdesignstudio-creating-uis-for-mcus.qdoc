    \title Creating UIs for MCUs

    \l{\QMCU} enables you to use subsets of components to create UIs for
    devices that are powered by microcontroller units (MCU). The subset of
    supported components depends on the \QMCU version that you use for
    development.

    To develop for MCUs, \l{Creating Projects for MCUs}{create an MCU project}.
    Only the components available on MCUs are displayed in \l Components. Also,
    only a subset of properties is supported for the supported components. The
    properties that are not available on MCUs are marked in the \l Properties
    view with strikethrough text.

    For more information about the supported views and features, see \l{\QDS Features on MCU Projects}.

    For examples on how to use \QDS to design a UI for a specific MCU target
    device, see:
