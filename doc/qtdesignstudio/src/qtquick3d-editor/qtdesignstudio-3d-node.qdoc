    \title Node

    You can set properties, such as opacity and visibility, for 3D components
    that are based on the \uicontrol Node component. You can also modify their
    transformation properties. To modify 3D components, select the component
    and set its properties in \uicontrol Properties > \uicontrol Node and
    \uicontrol Transform.

    \section1 Setting the Node opacity and visibility

    You can set the opacity and visibility of 3D components that are based on
    the \uicontrol Node component in \uicontrol Properties > \uicontrol Node.

    All components have an \uicontrol Opacity value applied to them. The opacity
    of 100 makes a component fully opaque, while the opacity of 0 prevents a
    component from rendering at all.

    Just as modifying the position or rotation of a parent component affects
    all child components, opacity is multiplicatively cumulative through
    the transform hierarchy. A cube that is 50\% opaque inside a group that
    is 80\% opaque renders with an equivalent appearance of 40\% opacity
    (\c{0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4}). Setting the opacity of a group to 0 prevents
    any descendants within the group from rendering.

    The \uicontrol Visibility property provides an alternative way to hide and
    show components. It is useful when you want to show a component in a
    particular state, but hide it in another state, for example.

    The \uicontrol {Static flags} property is currently not used.

    \section1 Managing 3D transformations

    In 3D graphics, \e transformation refers to modifying the position, rotation,
    scale, or pivot of a component.

    You can manage 3D transformations for components that are based on the
    \uicontrol Node component in the \uicontrol Transform tab.

    The value of the \uicontrol Translation property contains the position
    translation of the component in the local coordinate space established by
    the parent component. The \uicontrol Orientation property specifies whether
    the left-handed or right-handed coordinate system is used.

    In the y-up left-handed coordinate system, increasing the value of x
    moves the component to the right, as seen from the default camera location,
    whereas increasing the value of y moves the component up. Increasing the
    value of z moves the component away from the camera.

    The value of the \uicontrol Rotation parameter sets the local rotation of
    the component in the space established by the parent component. The
    \uicontrol {Rotation order} property specifies whether the left-handed or
    right-handed (the values with \e r) rotation about the x, y, and z axes
    is applied, and the order in which the rotation is applied on each axis.

    The value of the \uicontrol Scale property sets the local scale of the
    component in the space established by the parent component. An odd number
    of negative scale values causes the component to render \e {inside-out},
    which cannot be seen due to backface-culling.

    The value of the \uicontrol Pivot property sets the local pivot offset for
    the component. You can think of the pivot as offsetting the geometry for the
    component away from the origin, allowing a component to rotate and scale
    around a point other than its local origin. Pivot values are applied before
    scaling and rotation values.

    A line is drawn in the \uicontrol{3D} view from the pivot point to the center
    of the component to provide a visual connection between them.

    \section2 Transformations after reparenting components

    Changing the parent-child relationship in the component hierarchy is referred
    to as \e reparenting. To reparent a component in \QDS, drag it to a new parent
    in the \uicontrol Navigator view. After reparenting \QDS will automatically adjust
    the position, rotation, and scale of a 3D component to maintain its world-space
    location, orientation, and size, which ensures the component appears unchanged
    in the scene.

    \note If the ancestors of the reparented component have been both rotated and
    non-uniformly scaled, the scale is not adjusted at reparenting because it
    is impossible to accurately replicate it with only three-axis scaling.

    \note If the reparented component or its new or old ancestors have timeline
    animation affecting any of the 3D transformation properties, the transformation
    properties of the reparented component are not adjusted.

    Since reparenting is always done in \l {States} {Base State}, the adjusted
    transformation after reparenting is based on the  \uicontrol {Base State}
    values, which it modifies regardless of the current state.

    To preserve the nodeâ€™s local transformation relative to its new parent, hold
    \key Alt while reparenting.
