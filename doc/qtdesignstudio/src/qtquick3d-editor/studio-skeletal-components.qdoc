    \title Skeletal animation

    Skeletal animation is a technique used in computer animation. In skeletal
    animation, a character is represented in the form of a surface representation
    (skin or mesh), and a skeleton. This portrays how the character can move,
    inspired by how a physical skeleton works for vertebrates. The "bones" of the
    skeleton are represented by a hierarchy of joint nodes.

    The normal workflow is to use an external content creation tool to define
    the skeleton and the skin (this is sometimes also referred to as rigging),
    and import them to \QDS. You can then create skeletal animations using
    \uicontrol Skeleton and \uicontrol Joint components available in
    \uicontrol Components > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D}.

    \section1 Skeleton

    A \uicontrol Skeleton component determines a skeletal animation hierarchy
    and defines how a model can be animated using skeletal animation.
    It contains a hierarchy of \uicontrol Joint nodes. Each joint can be
    transformed for a skinning animation.

    \section1 Joint

    A \uicontrol Joint defines a node in a skeletal animation hierarchy
    and functions similarly to joints between bones in a human skeleton.
    It is a transformable node that must be contained inside a
    \uicontrol Skeleton component.

    Define properties for \uicontrol Joint components in \uicontrol Properties
    > \uicontrol Joint.

    Use the \uicontrol Index property to define the index of this joint.
    This index value is used in the \uicontrol {Joint semantic} custom geometry
    attribute.

    \note The \uicontrol Index values must be unique within the same
    \uicontrol Skeleton.

    Use the \uicontrol {Skeleton root} property to define the \uicontrol Skeleton
    that contains the \uicontrol Joint. Do note that all the \uicontrol Joints
    in the \uicontrol Skeleton must have the same \uicontrol {Skeleton root}
    for the animation to work properly.
