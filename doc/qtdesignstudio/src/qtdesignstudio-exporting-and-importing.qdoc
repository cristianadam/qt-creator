    \title Asset Creation with Other Tools

    Typically, you as a designer would design a UI using imaging and design
    tools, such as Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Figma, Blender, or Maya, and then
    send your design to a developer for implementation. You can use the \QB
    export tool to convert 2D assets into a metadata format supported by \QDS.
    You can use the export functionality of 3D graphics tools to save your 3D
    assets in a format that can be imported into \QDS.

    You can import the 2D and 3D assets into \QDS for editing before you
    submit the UI to the developer for adding the functionality to the
    application.

    If you want to make further changes to your components in the design tool,
    you can export the UI files back into the metadata format, which you can
    then import back into the design tool by using \QB. For example, you could
    create components in a design tool and export them to \QDS before you start
    making instances of them. In \QDS, you can add functionality to the
    components, such as button states and then bring them back to the design
    tool as assets. If you use functional \QDS components in the design tool,
    you will find it easier to merge new iterations of the design to \QDS and
    continue to build the components there.

    The following image describes the workflow using \QBPS and \QDS:

    The workflow consists of the following steps:

    \list 1
        \li Export your design from a design tool into the metadata format.
        \li \l{Creating Projects}{Create a project} in \QDS and import the
            metadata file to it.
        \li Edit the imported components and create more components in
            the \l {2D} and \l {3D} view.
        \li Animate your design in \l {Transitions} or \l Timeline
            and \l {Curves}.
        \li Create interactions in \l States and \l {Connections}.

    \list
        \li \l {Exporting from Design Tools}

            Export designs containing 2D and 3D assets into a metadata format
            that you can import to projects in \QDS.
        \li \l{Importing Designs}

            Import assets that you exported from design tools to a \QDS project
            and edit them in the \uicontrol Design mode to create a UI.
        \li \l {Exporting Components}

            Export UI files (.ui.qml) back to the metadata format and PNG assets
            to generate native file formats in design tools using \QB.
     \endlist
