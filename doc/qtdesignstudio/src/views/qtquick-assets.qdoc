    \title Assets

    The \uicontrol Assets view lists available assets.

    \uicontrol {Assets} displays the images and other files
    that you add to the project folder by dragging-and-dropping external asset
    files to \QDS or by selecting \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    . For more information about importing assets to \QDS, see
    \l {Importing 2D Assets} and \l {Importing 3D Assets}.

    To add assets to your UI, drag-and-drop them from
    \uicontrol Assets to \l Navigator, \l {Form Editor}, or \l {3D Editor}.

    To add multiple assets to your UI simultaneously, multiselect them first by
    holding \key Ctrl and clicking the asset files you wish to select.

    When you drag-and-drop assets from \uicontrol Assets to \l Navigator
    or \l {Form Editor}, component instances with a suitable type are
    automatically created for you. For example, instances of the
    \l{Images}{Image} component will be created for graphics files.
