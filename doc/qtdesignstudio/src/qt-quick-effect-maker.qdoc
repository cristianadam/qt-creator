    \title Working with Effects in Qt Quick Effect Maker

    The Qt Quick Effect Maker is a tool to create high-performace
    shader effects in Qt Quick.

    You can import these effects to \QDS and you can run Qt Quick Effect Maker
    from \QDS.

    \section1 Creating Effects

    When you run Qt Quick Effect Maker, it starts with an empty project. To
    create your effect, add nodes to the node tree.

    Consider the following things when creating effects:

    \list
      \li Some nodes do not function alone, they need a helper node. For
      example, the \uicontrol FastBlur node needs a \uicontrol BlurHelper node
      and the \uicontrol Noise node needs a \uicontrol NoiseHelper node. If the
      node needs another node, it is mentioned in the node description.
      \li If your effect appears cropped, you need to go to \uicontrol Edit >
      \uicontrol {Project Settings} and increase the item padding.
    \endlist

    \section2 Creating a Blur Effect

    To create a blur effect:

    \list 1
      \li Add a \uicontrol FastBlur node to the node tree.
      \li Add a \uicontrol BlurHelper node to the node tree. You need the
      \uicontrol BlurHelper node for all effects that contains a blur effect.
    \endlist

    You can now select the \uicontrol FastBlur node and in the settings, change
    the \uicontrol fastBlurAmount value to control the amount of blur.

    \section3 Adjusting Item borders

    The effect appears cropped. You need to adjust item borders:

    \list 1
      \li Select \inlineimage effect-item-borders-icon.png
      to display item borders.
      \image blur-effect-step-2.png
      \li Go to \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol {Project Settings}.
      \li Set the item padding for all sides to 100.

    \endlist

    Now, you can see the complete blur effect.
